This paper focuses on the study of structural high-cycle fatigue problems commonly encountered in engineering and presents a fatigue-constrained isogeometric topology optimization (FCITO) method. First, the isogeometric analysis (IGA) framework for high-cycle fatigue problems is outlined. On this basis, a mathematical model for the FCITO method is established using the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method. The model aims to minimize compliance while considering volume and the Soderberg fatigue criterion constraints. Additionally, a modified P-norm function is employed to manage the numerous fatigue constraints, while the relaxation method is applied to address singularity issues. Moreover, the complete sensitivity equations for the objective function, volume constraint function, and fatigue constraint function are also provided. Finally, the effectiveness and capability of the presented FCITO method are demonstrated through several 2D and 3D examples.
