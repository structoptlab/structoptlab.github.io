Welcome to the Structural Optimization Lab!
Our team is engaged in research on structural CAD/CAE technologies, isogeometric analysis, topology optimization, multiscale structural optimization, and CPU/GPU high-performance numerical computing. We are committed to developing an independent, performance/function-driven adaptive generative design platform, enabling efficient and high-quality integrated design of product structures.

Lab openings
======
We are seeking highly motivated researchers (Postdoc/PhD/Master/Undergraduate) with backgrounds in mechanical engineering, mechanics, computer science, CAD/CAE, or related fields. Our lab focuses on structral optimization, intelligent algorithm development, and CAD/CAE integration, offering collaboration opportunities with world-leading institutions (UCSD, McGill University, etc.)

**Postdocs:** Email CV + 3 references + 5-slide research summary to wangyj84@scut.edu.cn
**Students:** Email CV + transcript to wangyj84@scut.edu.cn  
**Preferred skills:**
1. Topalogy aptimization / FEA / Programming (MATLAB/Pythan/C++)
2. Experience in industrial saftware or additive manufacturing

Recent News
======
* 6/2025, Our paper **Integrating large models with topology optimization for conceptual design realization** published in Advanced Engineering Informatics, is the paper integrating AI and topology optimization in our lab.
